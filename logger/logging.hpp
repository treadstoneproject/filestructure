// Provide logging facilities that treat log messages by their
// severities. If function |InitializeLogger| was invoked and was
// able to open files specified by the parameters, log messages of
// various severity will be written into corresponding files.
// Otherwise, all log messages will be written to stderr.
//
// Example:
/*
int main() {
InitializeLogger("/tmp/info.log", "/tmp/warn.log", "/tmp/erro.log");
LOG(INFO) << "An info message going into /tmp/info.log";
LOG(WARNING) << "An warn message going into /tmp/warn.log";
LOG(ERROR) << "An erro message going into /tmp/erro.log";
LOG(FATAL) << "An fatal message going into /tmp/erro.log, "
<< "and kills current process by a segmentation fault.";

// The basic mechanism of logging.{h,cc} is as follows:
// - LOG(severity) defines a Logger instance, which records the severity.
// - LOG(severity) then invokes Logger::Start(), which invokes Logger::Stream
// to choose an output stream, outputs a message head into the stream and
// flush.
// - The std::ostream reference returned by LoggerStart() is then passed to
// user-specific output operators (<<), which writes the log message body.
// - When the Logger instance is destructed, the destructor appends flush.
// If severity is FATAL, the destructor causes SEGFAULT and core dump.
//
// It is important to flush in Logger::Start() after outputing message
// head. This is because that the time when the destructor is invoked
// depends on how/where the caller code defines the Logger instance.
// If the caller code crashes before the Logger instance is properly
// destructed, the destructor might not have the chance to append its
// flush flags. Without flush in Logger::Start(), this may cause the
// lose of the last few messages. However, given flush in Start(),
// program crashing between invocations to Logger::Start() and
// destructor only causes the lose of the last message body; while the
// message head will be there.
